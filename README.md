## Task
Create a small web application to take photos with your webcam, add some stickers, and share it to other users.
Shared photos must be likeable and commentable.

## Constraints
- Backend must be coded with PHP and standard library only.
- Frontend must use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries).
- PDO must be used to communicate with database.

## Solution
I used a MVC pattern to serve html pages to users complimented with some JavaScript, styled using SemanticUI.
I chose MySQL as database.
